or general manager and addresses the question of why some firms outperform others. Firm performance therefore lies at the core of strategic management as firms use their resources and adapt to their environments to help them win against rivals in the marketplace. To help understand what it takes for firms to succeed in today&rsquo;s marketplace, this course will highlight how to assess the firm&rsquo;s internal and external situation, to appreciate the elements of a successful strategy, and to understand the challenges of implementing such strategies under conditions of entrepreneurial uncertainty.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c15 c5">Learning Objectives.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;By the end of this module, students should be able to:</span></p><ol class="c20 lst-kix_mg0ytkf3qcay-0 start" start="1"><li class="c6 c33"><span class="c17 c15">Define strategic management and recognize its importance for professional and personal endeavors</span></li><li class="c6 c33"><span class="c17 c15">Describe the competitive landscape and explain how globalization and technological change can shape it</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c3">Describe the work of strategic leaders.</span></li><li class="c6 c33"><span class="c17 c15">Explain the strategic management process</span></li></ol><p class="c7"><span class="c15 c5">Big Question Question: </span><span class="c3">What is Strategic Management and the Strategic Decision Making Process?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c21 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c7 c31" id="h.uzlc8xhb3rcu"><span class="c4">DEFINING STRATEGY</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c1 c5">Strategy</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c15">is</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c15">an integrated and coordinated set of commitments and actions designed to leverage internal resources and core competencies that align with factors in the external environment to provide a firm with a </span><span class="c1 c5">competitive advantage</span><span class="c15">.

These new ventures usually require more time to earn acceptable returns, but their success is often much more risky than established firms. Two main differences distinguish startups from more established firms and consequently increase the riskiness of their success: 1) Increased uncertainty and 2) Decreased resources. Because entrepreneurial startups are defined by doing something new or unproven, they often don&rsquo;t have past history or adequate benchmarks with which to make strategic decisions or to measure success. In addition, startups don&rsquo;t have the financial foundation or the reputational history of established firms to positively influence their business activities. As will be discussed further, however, these characteristics can be beneficial as entrepreneurial startups are able to be more nimble and flexible, allowing them to capitalize on changes in the marketplace more easily than large, bureaucratic firms.</span></p><p class="c40"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 72.00px; height: 72.00px;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/MGEiR1zWnkqu1e6CwR8orloBiUrkfVUfL_ghQUgHA_pLyTaLJie6YFIrwkofF5Tp7K1hxWbUoqbvP0Vl6TeeZJDfH9NkeJGZ2ao8L9fsTzC8K8uXTl_HwxZtVkTjEgLqTCA5WALI" style="width: 72.00px; height: 72.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c1">RESPONSE_QUESTION: &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">What advantages and disadvantages do you think startups have over larger, more established firms?</span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c56"><span class="c15">One framework that can assist firms in their quest for a sustainable competitive advantage is the </span><span class="c1 c5">strategic management process</span><span class="c3">, which encompasses the full set of commitments, decisions, and actions required for a firm to be successful.

Beyond simply being more entrepreneurial and innovative, leaders must also change the way they interact with their employees, since personal connections are even more important as digitization and electronic communication become more and more prevalent.</span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c1 c5">Strategic flexibility</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;represents the set of capabilities &ndash; in all areas of their operations &ndash; that firms use to respond to the various demands and opportunities found in dynamic, uncertain environments. This implies that firms must develop certain capabilities, including the capacity to learn continuously, that will provide the firm with new skill sets. However, because inertia can build up over time that makes it harder to change strategies and update paradigms, those working within firms to develop strategic flexibility should understand the task is not an easy one. As a result, sometimes firms&rsquo; past strategies and core competencies create barriers for change and reduce strategic flexibility. Strategic leaders who are capable of rapidly and broadly applying what they learn are more likely to keep pace with the evolution and changes occurring in the marketplace, which will then increase the probability of succeeding in uncertain, hypercompetitive environments.</span></p><p class="c9 c10"><span class="c21 c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">RESPONSE_QUESTION: &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Overall, does it take more effort to make small, periodic changes or to wait and make more dramatic changes when these become necessary?</span></p><h6 class="c38" id="h.894tqlfasupl"><span class="c1 c21">&nbsp;</span></h6><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c1">Who are strategic leaders?</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c15">Although dependent upon the size of each organization, most organizations have a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or top manager and this individual is the </span><span class="c15 c5">primary</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;organizational strategist for that organization. Larger organizations may have a few or several top-level managers, executives, or a top management team. Smaller organizations may have a single individual who fills the role of the chief strategist: the CEO, founder, or owner could all be the same person. What&rsquo;s important to understand, however, is that no matter what role or position employees hold in an organization, they all can engage in and support the strategic decision making process and need to take responsibility for the strategic actions of their spheres of influence.</span></p><p class="c9 c10"><span class="c21 c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">RESPONSE_QUESTION: &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">How can you be a strategic leader for your organization?</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c1">What are the responsibilities of strategic leaders?</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">Managers at the top of an organization play decisive roles in the entire firms&rsquo; efforts to achieve their desired strategic outcomes. As organizational strategists, top managers are primarily responsible for deciding how firm resources will be developed or acquired, at what cost, and how they will be used or allocated throughout the organization. Strategic leaders must also consider the risks of the various actions under consideration and how they align generally with the vision, mission, and objectives of the firm as a whole.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c1">What are the characteristics of strategic leaders?</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c15">Although no one &ldquo;right way&rdquo; exists for strategic leaders, common characteristics are shared by those who are best suited to succeed in a rapidly changing and evolving environment. Successful strategic leaders rely on thorough </span><span class="c1">analysis</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;before taking action; however, too much time spent assessing all the various elements that could influence a decision could result in &ldquo;analysis paralysis,&rdquo; so strategists must balance research with action. As mentioned above, strategic leaders can and should come from </span><span class="c1">various levels</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;throughout the organization, and firms that empower their employees to be involved in strategic decisions that impact their business activities create strategic leaders. Successful leaders should also have goals, objectives, and desires to </span><span class="c1">continually improve</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;the performance of the firm. Leaders who are focused on continual improvement also need to come up with creative and </span><span class="c1">innovative</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;ways to do so, which often involves recognizing or creating opportunities to add value to their customers others don&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t see. Building, cultivating, and leveraging </span><span class="c1">relationships</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;can also be a source of innovative strategic opportunities, so leaders should be willing and able to focus on these relationships both inside and outside the firm. Finally, effective strategic leaders need to have a </span><span class="c1">global mindset </span><span class="c3">to help them understand and anticipate how developments around the globe can be sources of either opportunities for or threats to their strategic activities.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 497.00px; height: 284.00px;"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FT0b52wEKpUlROyoAtJmRWmpqwWPHuPDZA8lTUOFbOLdGsFu8T4TnNQy42PYrr1uSRi4f74Yds0RaezEtRTnvuIJlj-OrT_-qaCJ8Y7ml6cuJwi0k57-ZDZVaOkpKbmf4xj4KDcH" style="width: 497.00px; height: 284.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c13 c10"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">Reflection Questions: </span><span class="c3">Which of the characteristics of strategic leaders do you possess?

Its devices allowed users to receive e-mail and other data in real time globally, with enhanced security features. For executives, a BlackBerry was not just a tool to increase productivity &ndash; and to free them from their laptops &ndash; but also an important status symbol. As a consequence, by 2008 BlackBerry&rsquo;s market cap had peaked at $75 billion. Yet by 2015, this valuation had fallen more than 90 percent, to less than $7 billion. What happened?</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the iPhone by Apple in 2007 changed the game in the mobile device industry. Equipped with a camera, the iPhone&rsquo;s slick design offered a user interface with a touchscreen including a virtual keyboard. The iPhone connected seamlessly to other cellular networks and Wi-Fi. Combined with thousands of apps via the Apple iTunes store, the iPhone provided a powerful user experience, or as the late Steve Jobs said, &ldquo;The Internet in your pocket.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, BlackBerry engineers and executives initially dismissed the iPhone as a mere toy with poor security features. Everyday users thought differently. They has less concern for encrypted software security than they had desire for having fun with a device that allowed them to text, surf the web, take pictures, play games, and do e-mail. Although BlackBerry devices were great in productivity applications, such as receiving and responding to e-mail via typing on its iconic physical keyboard, they provided a poor mobile web browsing experience.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially, mobile devices were issued top-down by corporate IT departments. The only available device for executives was a company-issued BlackBerry. This made life easy for IT departments, ensuring network security. Consumers, however, began to bring their personal iPhones to work and used them for corporate communication and productivity applications. This bottom-up groundswell of the BYOT (&ldquo;bring your own technology&rdquo;) movement forced corporate IT departments to open up their services beyond the BlackBerry.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c28"><span class="c21 c1">DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</span></p><ol class="c20 lst-kix_tenbtq3c0gsi-0 start" start="1"><li class="c9 c39"><span class="c3">What allowed BlackBerry to build a competitive advantage?

His insight was focused inside the firm, namely on the resources each firm possesses, and had two main arguments. The first was the concept of </span><span class="c1">resource heterogeneity</span><span class="c15">, which means that every firm (or person) possesses a unique bundle of resources and capabilities that can be used to form the basis of a sustainable competitive advantage. The second was </span><span class="c1">resource immobility</span><span class="c3">, meaning some resources can&rsquo;t be easily acquired or transported from one firm to another. These two conditions help explain why firms are so different, particularly in the performance outcomes. How firms can use this uniqueness to form a sustainable competitive advantage is the goal of internal analysis and will be explored in this module.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 498.00px; height: 285.00px;"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DWx7W8441sV595Vnr_sfA1rej8h_gTKu0sKV-_6ElBRMXyQ3ICjtu0izfF6BnMFIpGU4dPPeet2WBK-sBeElVwguc2IKJxkL-aWMbTjZ5E1YxJI-yt_7Jq8PLSMmzPe99UxiBpGE" style="width: 498.00px; height: 285.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.gqp5ljmtbhnr"><span class="c4">Resources</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Resources are defined as inputs into the firm&rsquo;s production processes, which help the firm create value for its customers. A firm&rsquo;s competitive advantage is often strongly related to the resources it holds and how they are managed. Resources are the foundation for the strategic decision making process and can generate competitive advantages leading to superior performance when they are bundled together uniquely. As such, strategic decision makers should analyze the internal environment with a focus on understanding how their resources and capabilities might be leveraged and bundled together in a unique, value-adding manner.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c15">Resources are typically classified as either tangible or intangible. </span><span class="c1">Tangible resources</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;are assets that are usually easily observable and quantifiable, and can be classified as follows: </span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_mtld6i1f0iy2-0 start"><li class="c7 c26"><span class="c3">Physical &ndash; property, equipment, inventory, land</span></li><li class="c7 c26"><span class="c3">Financial &ndash; the ability to generate funds through internal business activities or the ability to borrow money</span></li><li class="c7 c26"><span class="c3">Organizational &ndash; formal reporting structures and processes</span></li></ul><p class="c11"><span class="c1">Intangible resources</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;are often more difficult to see and can be deeply rooted in the business&rsquo; or individual&rsquo;s history.

For example, a delivery truck is a tangible resource, but it can only be used on one route in one physical location at a time, and the driver can only be deployed in that one truck at one point in time. Similarly, the financial investment in the delivery truck can only be used for that one truck. Intangible resources, on the other hand, like the ability to innovate a new manufacturing process, can be used on several product lines in multiple locations simultaneously.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c21 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11 c10"><span class="c21 c1"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">Reflection question:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Do you think tangible or intangible resources are more likely to lead to a sustainable competitive advantage?</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c21 c1">Sources of Competitive Advantage</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c15">Intangible resources are often more difficult to see or understand, which can make them difficult to imitate. In addition, intangible resources, can be the result of </span><span class="c1">unique historical conditions</span><span class="c15">, such as an invention, strategically important location, or other &ldquo;right place at the right time&rdquo; situations that gave the firm a head start over other firms. Other intangible resources, such as company culture or network connections, can be </span><span class="c1">socially complex</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;and reliant upon numerous interactions among people inside and outside an organization. The old saying of, &ldquo;Who you know is more important than what you know&rdquo; is based on this idea, where often problems are solved because people know who to ask to help solve them rather than simply knowing the answers themselves. Intangible resources can also be </span><span class="c1">causally ambiguous</span><span class="c3">, where the way firms combine and use the various resources to create and deliver value to their customers is not easily identified or understood. Because of the complex and ambiguous nature of intangible resources, they are more difficult to imitate and often form the basis of a sustainable competitive advantage. The importance of imitability will be discussed further below.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c7 c31" id="h.niovxhhy7dt2"><span class="c55">Capabilities and Core Competencies</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c15">Resources are the building blocks for a firm&rsquo;s activities, but they alone will generally not be sufficient to provide a firm with a sustainable competitive advantage. The key lies in how those resources are bundled, leveraged, or transformed into capabilities. </span><span class="c1">Capabilities </span><span class="c3">are a firm&rsquo;s capacity to use individual firm resources to accomplish desired outcomes. These capabilities develop over time as a result of complex interactions between a firm&rsquo;s tangible and intangible resources, driven by the human capital (people) within the firm. A firm&rsquo;s ability to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage therefore lies in its knowledge base, ingenuity, and ability of its employees to successfully leverage firm capabilities. The knowledge and ability of the firm&rsquo;s employees may be one of its most significant sources of competitive advantage because it is a manifestation of everything the firm has learned, and therefore everything it knows about how to successfully combine, link, or bundle sets of individual resources in order to develop and maintain critical capabilities that form the foundation for creating core competencies and, ultimately, a sustainable competitive advantage. As a result, firms need to recognize and support the value employees hold for the organization and ensure they are able to not only establish, but nurture, acquire, and develop new skills to enhance existing capabilities and core competencies. By doing so, firms can continue to evolve and will be more likely to stay ahead of competitors who are also developing their own capabilities.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c15">After a firm understands its resources and capabilities, the next step is to identify its </span><span class="c1">core competencies</span><span class="c3">, which are a subset of capabilities the firm does especially well relative to competitors in the marketplace. These core competencies develop from the resources it acquires and builds and the capabilities it develops and &ndash; similar to all of its capabilities &ndash; also emerge over time through the process of learning how to combine, develop, and leverage its various resources and capabilities. Through these core competencies, a firm will be able to produce goods or services with features and characteristics that are better, faster, and/or cheaper than rivals and can add unique value to its customers, which will improve its likelihood of success.</span></p><p class="c8 c10"><span class="c21 c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">RESPONSE_QUESTION: &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">What are the core competencies of firms from whom you purchase products and services?</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 496.00px; height: 286.00px;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/F78Jxj4hdopLP7Os6YUtss9tCDF5etsdJpQI1Qg94r7N5OaYZ4rvSHx6Ut81W_C6kifFDJ66ROBBohQWGPFIWycNf8D80TBguBbUU8Uous53h8uAkwKSOQC6Ufu9UzTjnKGyYrad" style="width: 496.00px; height: 286.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c8 c31" id="h.2wlmakhzv4ey"><span class="c4">Evaluating Core Competencies for Sustainable Competitive Advantage</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c15">Not all resources and capabilities are strategic assets, meaning they have competitive value and the potential to be a basis of a firm&rsquo;s sustainable competitive advantage. According to the Resource-based View of the firm, four criteria must be satisfied in order to do so, encapsulated by the acronym VRIO. The first is </span><span class="c1">value</span><span class="c15">, where a core competence can either exploit opportunities or minimize threats in the market and must be appreciated by customers such that they are willing to pay for them. The second is </span><span class="c1">rarity</span><span class="c15">, where the core competence is currently possessed by few, if any, competitors in the market. If numerous firms possess the core competence, the likelihood of many firms using them to make the same strategic decisions is high, thus eroding any advantage one firm might have over another. Third, the core competence needs to be </span><span class="c1">costly or difficult to imitate</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;or develop, which helps to protect both its value and rarity. In addition to being directly imitated or copied, the result of the core competence must also be difficult to substitute by other means. Finally, the firm must be </span><span class="c1">organized</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;well to effectively and efficiently utilize the core competence in its business processes.</span></p><p class="c36"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 498.00px; height: 289.00px;"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yhOqvVyzXGo-Su4faXp7quxuip18qnJJMoNc64swGzuGoPHPn5yGItAys1u5gi_vXWmA3S1T3AzvCG0JTZDlZCxvntgoFGTLQFnd7gpqyFyNNGhpxcDNkYeJGeSvZNlgJgOY--an" style="width: 498.00px; height: 289.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c15">The internal analysis process, then, takes the core competence through the VRIO sequence to help the firm determine what the strategic and competitive outcome of exploiting a core competence might be. A core competence that is not valuable, if presented to the marketplace, could lead to a </span><span class="c15 c5">competitive disadvantage</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;since no customers would appreciate it or be willing to pay for it. A core competence that is valuable but not rare will not allow the firm to differentiate itself in any meaningful way, which would, at best, lead to </span><span class="c15 c5">competitive parity</span><span class="c15">. A core competence that is valuable and rare but that can be quickly or easily imitated or developed by rival firms will only give the focal firm a </span><span class="c15 c5">temporary competitive advantage</span><span class="c15">, which will only last until customers see the same or similar competence offered by other firms.

How would you mitigate those risks?</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">However, outsourcing can have negative consequences as well, so several key issues must be considered to reduce the risks of outsourcing itself. First, firms should not outsource those business activities where the firm itself can create and capture value. Doing so can decrease the ability for the firm to monitor or to learn from that activity, and by providing another firm with the keys to its competitive advantage, the firm could make itself obsolete. Second, firms should not outsource activities that it uses to neutralize environmental threats or to complete necessary ongoing organizational tasks. Not everything should be outsourced, and if the firm is critically dependent on an input to complete its necessary tasks, outsourcing may leave itself vulnerable to the system shutting down. Next, firms should also not outsource capabilities critical to its success, even though the capabilities themselves are not actual sources of competitive advantage. Finally, firms should not outsource activities that stimulate the development of new capabilities and competencies. In a globally competitive and changing environment, learning is critical for ongoing firm success, and removing activities that help it learn could put a firm at a competitive disadvantage in the future.</span></p><p class="c36"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 499.00px; height: 285.00px;"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/O1xW3Q34oQDlq--Geh2vuTdqzHNgaW71sy1pVsY55H-zEIvLCh-HC6Unhyum-lDrvFKRP5KChJjcmnBwVCpWvVFt2QtPXtcAA015dotnJGIv1BgEH5S8pBdVXDCrK5EYvbNMjBjY" style="width: 499.00px; height: 285.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">In order to successfully manage the outsourcing process, skills like deal making/negotiations, relationship development, and monitoring are critical.

If a firm has weak capabilities or does not possess core competencies in areas deemed necessary to create a competitive advantage, these necessary resources should either be developed or acquired in order to build the needed capabilities and competencies.

In 2008, the then 27-year-old founded Groupon, a daily-deal website that connects local retailers and other merchants to consumers by offering goods and services at a discount. Groupon creates marketplaces by bringing the brick-and-mortar world of local commerce onto the Internet. The company basically offers a &ldquo;group-coupon.&rdquo; If more than a predetermined number of Groupon users sign up for the offer, the deal is extended to all Groupon users. For example, a local spa may offer a massage for $40 instead of the regular $80. If more than say 10 people sign up, the deal becomes reality. The users prepay $40 for the coupon, which Groupon splits 50-50 with the local merchant. Inspired by how Amazon.com has become the global leader in ecommerce, Mason&rsquo;s strategic vision for Groupon was to be the global leader in local commerce. To target and fine-tune its local deals, Groupon relies heavily on human labor to do the selling.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measured by its explosive growth, Groupon became one of the most successful recent Internet startups, with over 260 million subscribers and serving over 500,000 merchants in the United States and some 50 countries. Indeed, Groupon&rsquo;s success attracted a $6 billion buyout offer by Google in early 2011, which Mason declined. The spurned Google later created its own daily-deal version with Google offers, and later Amazon (via LivingSocial), and Facebook also moved in. In November 2011, Groupon held a successful initial public offering (IPO), valued at more than $16 billion with a share price of over $26. But a year later, Groupon&rsquo;s share price had fallen 90 percent to just $2.63, resulting in a market cap of less than $1.8 billion. In early 2013, Mason posted a letter for Groupon employees on the web, arguing that it would leak anyway, stating, &ldquo;After four and a half intense and wonderful years as CEO of Groupon, I&rsquo;ve decided that I&rsquo;d like to spend more time with my family. Just kidding &ndash; I was fired today.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c58"><span class="c21 c1">DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">1.

As such, firms&rsquo; strategic leaders need to be aware of, understand the implications of, and identify patterns represented in these changes by taking actions to improve the firm&rsquo;s competitive position, to improve operational efficiency, and to be effective global competitors. Understanding the external environment helps build the firm&rsquo;s base of knowledge and information that can be used to: (1) help build new capabilities and core competencies, (2) buffer the firm from negative environmental impacts, and (3) pursue opportunities to better serve stakeholders&rsquo; needs. The strategic challenge is to develop an understanding of the implications of these elements and factors for a firm&rsquo;s competitive position.

As firms in the same industry compete for market share and overall profitability, the strategies implemented by these companies influence each other and include a broad mix of competitive strategies. Whereas factors in the general environment discussed above tend to have an indirect effect on strategic formulation and implementation, the effects of the industry environment tend to be much more direct. As a result, industry and individual firm profitability tend to be influenced by five competitive forces, called Porter&rsquo;s Five Forces. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c15">Named after Michael Porter, Harvard professor and the &ldquo;Godfather&rdquo; of Strategic Management, </span><span class="c1">Five Forces</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;analysis usually has a more direct impact on the types of competitive actions and reactions a firm will take in a given industry. Essentially, Five Forces analysis examines competition from a more holistic view, where different actors in a given industry &ndash; or a specific part of an industry &ndash; are competing for profitability. Five Forces analysis is also widely used to determine the overall attractiveness of one industry versus another, where an industry in which the Forces are strong is usually less profitable. It is also used to identify the threats and opportunities within various parts of the industry value chain.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">The Five Forces of interest are: bargaining power of suppliers, bargaining power of buyers, intensity of rivalry, threat of substitutes, and threat of new entrants. In essence, numerous actors in the industry environment can be considered &ldquo;competitors&rdquo; for profitability as firms interact to produce goods and services. So even though suppliers, for example, are partners and integral in providing necessary raw materials for the firm to use in production, in a zero sum environment, the higher prices a supplier charges, the more expensive the focal firm&rsquo;s production process will be, which will ultimately decrease overall firm profitability. Similarly, the lower the price customers pay for the firm&rsquo;s goods and services, the lower the profitability for the firm. In this regard, the various players in an industry are competing for circumstances that benefit their individual firm, which result in higher performance and profitability.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Another thing to keep in mind is the dynamic nature of industry players, where current suppliers could become direct competitors by integrating forward, current buyers (customers) could become competitors by integrating backwards, and firms that are not competitors today could produce products that serve as substitutes for existing products offered by firms in an industry, transforming themselves into competitors. In addition, new competitors can come from international sources, so maintaining a global mindset (and mindfulness) is important when forecasting the evolution of an industry.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 497.00px; height: 286.00px;"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/EHANO7BjZvnkctpKc2Xo2MNBIu7Mfs1QRVcw64lX7Il2Ti7az-059LYecx7WaoSh4uR6eG0Cun4S94OZWOSKNKc3t2P_D7OAyDK3PChjgAepfqqR-SYDsLaeCtMPlpd5ixr5_-BM" style="width: 497.00px; height: 286.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Further discussion of each of the Five Forces is as follows:</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c15">The </span><span class="c1">bargaining power of suppliers</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is powerful when firm profitability is reduced by its suppliers&rsquo; actions. Suppliers can exert their power by raising prices or by restricting the quantity and/or quality of the goods they provide. Their power is generally stronger when few suppliers exist or the product is unique or highly specialized, since their product is more rare and valuable. The more important the suppliers&rsquo; good or services are to the focal firm and the higher its switching costs (meaning the financial, cognitive, or psychological/emotional expenditures incurred for a customer to switch to a different supplier), the stronger the power of the suppliers. Generally, the power of suppliers is increased when: </span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_cdx343kz3kjw-0 start"><li class="c40 c39"><span class="c3">The supplier segment of the industry is dominated by a few large companies and is more concentrated than the industry to which it sells</span></li><li class="c40 c39"><span class="c3">Satisfactory substitute products are not available to industry firms</span></li><li class="c40 c39"><span class="c3">Industry firms are not a significant customer group for the supplier group</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c3">Suppliers&rsquo; goods are critical to buyers&rsquo; marketplace success</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c3">Effectiveness or uniqueness of suppliers&rsquo; products has created high switching costs for buyers</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c3">Suppliers represent a credible threat to integrate forward into the buyers&rsquo; industry, especially when suppliers have substantial resources and provide highly differentiated products</span></li></ul><p class="c11"><span class="c15">For the </span><span class="c1">bargaining power of buyers</span><span class="c3">, customers are usually interested in purchasing products at the lowest possible price, which in turn provides a lower level of profitability for the selling firm (or supplier). To reduce cost or to maximize value, customers will typically bargain for higher quality or greater levels of service, which is usually more expensive for selling firms, and increases competition among firms in the industry. The exact opposite of the power of suppliers, if few buyers exist, the focal firm&rsquo;s products or services are not specialized or unique and not important to the buyer, and the lower their switching costs, the stronger the power of the buyers. For both of these, the higher the likelihood of vertical integration &ndash; either forward for the suppliers or backwards for the buyers &ndash; the more power each group has. Generally, the power of buyers is increased when: </span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_9qf9yr4o6h5d-0 start"><li class="c7 c26"><span class="c3">Buyers are important to sellers because they purchase a large portion of the supply industry&rsquo;s total sales</span></li><li class="c7 c26"><span class="c3">Products purchased represent a significant portion of the seller&rsquo;s annual revenues</span></li><li class="c7 c26"><span class="c3">Buyers are able to switch to another supplier&rsquo;s product at little, if any, cost</span></li><li class="c7 c26"><span class="c3">Suppliers&rsquo; products are undifferentiated and standardized, and</span></li><li class="c7 c26"><span class="c3">Buyers represent a real threat to integrate backward into the suppliers&rsquo; industry using resources or expertise</span></li></ul><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Leveraging the vast amount of information about manufacturer&rsquo;s costs and numerous alternatives available on the internet, consumers are increasing their bargaining power in many industries. Switching costs are also dropping when customers decide to purchase from one manufacturer rather than another or from one seller as opposed to a second or third one.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c15">The </span><span class="c1">intensity of rivalry</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;in an industry is often higher when the concentration of the industry is high, meaning one firm or a small group of firms can yield high market power. This also occurs when the competitors are relatively equally balanced. When an industry is highly fragmented with numerous smaller firms, certain pockets of the industry might see strong rivalry, but the industry as a whole is not dominated by any one firm or small groups of firms. When industry growth is slow and/or has high fixed costs, firms try to maximize the use of their productive capacity and will fight over a &ldquo;fixed pie&rdquo; of existing customers, which will also tend to increase rivalry. Similarly, when industry players have a lack of differentiation in their products or services and buyers have low switching costs, intensity of competition will increase for the existing customer base and rivalry will tend to focus on price rather than customer service or the underlying characteristics of the product or service. A further exploration into competitive dynamics between firms is in Module 5.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c15">The </span><span class="c1">threat of substitutes </span><span class="c15">is generally high when customers&rsquo; needs can be satisfied with other products or services that come from </span><span class="c15 c60">outside</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;the industry. This threat is increased when switching costs for customers are low and when the substitute product&rsquo;s price is lower or its quality and characteristics are greater than or equal to those of the focal firm&rsquo;s products. In effect, the prices charged for substitutes represent the maximum firms in the focal industry can charge for their products and services, and the substitutes&rsquo; characteristics or quality set the floor for the firms&rsquo; products and services. Firms can offset the relative attractiveness of substitutes by differentiating their products and services in ways that are of value to customers, which can include price, quality, features, location, and/or level of service.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c15">Finally, the </span><span class="c1">threat of new entrants </span><span class="c3">can harm incumbent firms by either introducing innovative new products or production processes or by increasing supply without increasing the level of demand, which will tend to lower industry prices and thus profitability. The threat of new entrants is usually a function of barriers to entry, which include: </span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_ibju541jxg5o-0 start"><li class="c6"><span class="c1">Economies of scale</span><span class="c3">, where the price per unit decreases as more units are produced, which provides a cost advantage to the incumbent firm. Potential new entrants must therefore produce at a high level to achieve these cost advantages or by producing multiple products at once.</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c1">Product differentiation</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;makes it hard for new firms to compete without comparable product characteristics. In addition, the brand loyalty and reputation incumbent firms have achieved take a large investment and a lot of time, which put new entrants at a further disadvantage.</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c1">Capital requirements</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;that require high startup or maintenance costs for property, plant, equipment, and other resources for new entrants also increase risk and commitment levels.</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c1">Switching costs</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;make it expensive or difficult for customers to adopt new products and services.</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c1">Access to distribution channels</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;should not be assumed to exist equally for all firms in an industry, and new firms may incur high costs finding effective means to sell and distribute their products and services.</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c1">Cost advantages independent of scale</span><span class="c3">, which are similar to &ldquo;unique historical conditions&rdquo; where incumbent firms may have proprietary process (or product) technology, more favorable access to or control of raw materials, the best locations, brand recognition, favorable government subsidies, and so forth.</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c1">Government policy</span><span class="c3">, where the number of competitors is actually restricted through licensing and permit requirements at various levels of government (federal, state, and local).</span></li></ul><p class="c7"><span class="c3">When barriers to entry are high, the threat of new entrants tends to be lower. Firms trying to enter an industry should make strategic decisions that lower the barriers to entry, while those firms already in a given industry should make strategic decisions that increase barriers to entry. </span></p><p class="c11 c10"><span class="c21 c1"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">RESPONSE_QUESTION: &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">What specific strategies can you think of to help turn the Five Forces in your favor?</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">An effective Five Forces analysis helps entrepreneurs identify both the attractiveness of an industry as a whole as well as potentially profitable opportunities that might exist within an industry. By recognizing these opportunities, alert firms can combine existing industry-relevant trends with creative problem solving to add value in a unique way as a means to enter and to successfully compete in a given industry. In general, Porter&rsquo;s Five Forces have an inverse relationship with profitability in an industry, where the stronger the competitive forces, the lower the profit potential for an industry&rsquo;s firms. An unattractive industry has low entry barriers, suppliers and buyers with strong bargaining positions, strong competitive threats from product substitutes, and intense rivalry among competitors, which make it difficult for firms to achieve strategic competitiveness and earn above-average returns. An attractive industry has the mirror image of these features and offers more potential for favorable performance. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 498.00px; height: 281.00px;"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Yq5-b_tGXu2XcQyRsL3KPez0kqPoc08kkIaVEmTLcCs4_FE04kazkCPfZgKeXvIqZRgVAAbw8H3S1d2YCQIRVtYS3qNykY2mIHzvDfBzTnkfYJoXN6KMRDKFgikeoJDxt2HTdj41" style="width: 498.00px; height: 281.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1 c37">Competence Check: </span><span class="c3 c37">True or False: A firm at the center of Five Forces analysis can be both a buyer and a supplier.</span></p><p class="c11 c10"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.mege7osi1qcx"><span class="c4">Strategic Groups</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c15">Within each industry, all firms are not homogeneous. As with individuals, each firm has its own set of unique characteristics, which it uses to attempt to create value better, faster, and/or cheaper than rivals. However, firms can be categorized across certain dimensions that help form clusters or groups of firms. A subset of firms within an industry that emphasize similar strategic dimensions and therefore employ similar strategies are called </span><span class="c1">strategic groups</span><span class="c3">, which can help firms analyze and understand how industry dynamics work. Because members within a strategic group attempt to solve customers&rsquo; problems in very similar ways using similar strategies, competition within strategic groups tends to be stronger than between such groups. Further, because the underlying characteristics and strategies of the various groups are different, they are impacted differently by external environmental factors (think PESTEL) as well as by Porter&rsquo;s Five Forces; as a result, some groups face different opportunities and threats and are thus are more or less profitable than others. Changing underlying characteristics and subsequent strategies is not easy, however, which creates mobility barriers that make it difficult for firms from one strategic group to move to another group. The better a firm understands how the dynamics of an industry work, the better able it is to identify opportunities to compete in a given industry.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 499.00px; height: 286.00px;"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YXgfAgD663-XBABJRYNSDVj7rUMBIlAVgiewFBxo9vgavPyizaoffCRPZ8eXlJ1cpdhlq2QiEf1B-MT-udBI_WS2OemAbeJQBBeCxa0Clz6LncFacu23dtcMFky6I7N1xb68P9tE" style="width: 499.00px; height: 286.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.9o03kqbpvu98"><span class="c4">SWOT Analysis</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c15">A framework that ties internal analysis with external analysis is called </span><span class="c1">SWOT</span><span class="c3">, which stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.

Highly profitable GM had over half of the U.S. market to itself, but Ford and Chrysler both did well too. Then, in the 1960s and 1970s, foreign carmakers entered the U.S. market, at first mainly by importing vehicles from overseas plants. Foreign makers included the German brands Volkswagen (also owner of the Porsche and Audi brands), Daimler, and BMW, and the Japanese brands Toyota, Honda, and Nissan. By the 1980s, these foreign entrants had intensified competition and threated the Big Three&rsquo;s market share, such that the U.S. Congress passed significant import restrictions. Not to be stopped, the new players responded by building U.S. plants to comply with the new rules. More recently, Korean carmakers Hyundai and Kia have begun making and selling cars in the United States.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, the worldwide car manufacturing industry has seen few new entrants in general. In fact, no new major car manufacturers have emerged in the past couple of decades simply because few industrial products, save for jet airplanes and nuclear power plants, are as complex to build as traditional cars powered by internal combustion engines. Large-scale production is necessary for car manufacturers to be cost-competitive. In addition, the price for crude oil declined steeply from over $110 per barrel in the summer of 2014 to about $40 by spring 2015. With it, prices for a gallon of regular gas in the United States fell from over $4 in the summer of 2008 to less than $2 by 2015.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking a different approach, serial entrepreneur Elon Musk, who creates and runs new ventures to address not only economic but also social and environmental challenges, has entered this highly-competitive industry with his all-electric car company, Tesla. Although his other companies include SpaceX, the first private company to deliver a cargo payload to the International Space Station and SolarCity, basically the Walmart of solar panel installations, Tesla currently receives most of Musk&rsquo;s attention.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to complex gasoline engines, electric power trains use relatively simple motors and gearboxes with few parts. The Tesla Roadster, a $110,000 sports coupe with faster acceleration than a Porsche 911 GT, served as a prototype to demonstrate that electric vehicles can be more than mere golf carts. After selling some 2,500 Roadsters, Tesla discontinued its production to focus on its next car: the Model S, a four-door family sedan, with a base price of $71,000 before tax credits. The line appeals to a larger market and thus allows for larger production runs to drive down unit costs. The Model S received an outstanding market reception. It was awarded not only the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year, but also received the highest score of any car ever tested by Consumer Reports (99/100).

Similarly, a firm&rsquo;s strategy needs to help overcome weaknesses and minimize threats in order to be successful. The building of a firm&rsquo;s business-level strategy must align internal and external characteristics to help maximize its likelihood of achieving a sustainable competitive advantage.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c15 c5">Learning Objectives.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;By the end of this module, students should be able to:</span></p><ol class="c20 lst-kix_jp4khll1cv5h-0 start" start="1"><li class="c6"><span class="c3">Define business-level strategy and explain the differences between them</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c3">Apply the Five Forces model to each business-level strategy</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c3">Describe the advantages and disadvantages of each type of business-level strategy</span></li></ol><p class="c11"><span class="c15 c5">Big Question Question: </span><span class="c3">How does a firm leverage its internal and external analysis to choose an appropriate business-level strategy? What are the different types of strategies available to firms to help them achieve a sustainable competitive advantage?</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">This module focuses on the &ldquo;how&rdquo; of satisfying customer needs, which translates into business-level strategies. The purpose of a business-level strategy is to leverage the strengths of a firm matched with a promising opportunity in the external environment in order to provide unique value above and beyond what is offered by other firms. In essence, business-level strategies help the firm to either do things other firms are doing differently (such as at a lower cost with a lower price point) or to do completely different things (such as differentiating quality, features, or characteristics). Relatedly, two &ldquo;generic&rdquo; strategies identified in strategic management are cost leadership and differentiation. The better the firm is able to align the firm&rsquo;s core competencies and customer needs with an appropriate strategy, the better the likelihood of creating a sustainable competitive advantage.</span></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.7gg31delwhcc"><span class="c4">Customer Focus</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c3">When deciding what strategy to follow, firms must keep the needs and wants of the customer as the central point of its strategic decision making process. A firm&rsquo;s relationships with its customers will be strengthened when it provides superior value to them. This customer focus highlights the following questions firms must simultaneously consider throughout this process:</span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c21 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_fhqhfy7227am-0 start"><li class="c40 c26"><span class="c1 c5">Whom</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;to serve,</span></li><li class="c40 c26"><span class="c1 c5">What</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;customer needs or preferences will be satisfied,</span></li><li class="c40 c26"><span class="c1 c5">Which </span><span class="c3">core competencies are necessary to satisfy customer needs, and</span></li><li class="c40 c26"><span class="c1 c5">How</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;those needs will be satisfied through the strategy selected.</span></li></ul><p class="c45"><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 497.00px; height: 285.00px;"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/UZZIbK3JGpeSYFhS1DiA7SEK292_pid7rgZvvgtGH9025JZd93gcCLmygDSrxqIiRnwfSRDzPe4NPjhPLrYJg6FkbEvw3HR0YxOkOQmsaf8LuKrMFH9ZlGIr5Jwsr8ZtNEAaTg7m" style="width: 497.00px; height: 285.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c15">When identifying the customers to serve, the first step is to classify characters based on differences in needs or preferences, which is called </span><span class="c1">market segmentation</span><span class="c3">. This allows firms to come up with strategies that will address each segment and to also identify qualities that span multiple segments. By doing so, firms can allocate resources more efficiently and effectively to meet the needs of its various customers. Dimensions that can be used to identify customer segments include demographic, socioeconomic, geographic, psychological, and perceptual factors, as well as consumption patterns.</span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c3">Determining which customer needs to satisfy is important because successful firms learn how to deliver to customers what, when, and where they want it. Customers&rsquo; needs or wants are generally satisfied by the product&rsquo;s characteristics and features, so having frequent and close interactions with both current and potential customers helps the firm better understand what needs the customers want satisfied and can integrate them into their research and development and marketing activities. In addition, successful firms are also able to anticipate changes in customers&rsquo; needs and preferences, and by the process of continuous innovation and improvement, can repeatedly provide exceptional value for which customers are willing to pay.</span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c3">Core competencies are resources and capabilities that serve as a basis for a firm&rsquo;s sustainable competitive advantage relative to its rivals. Successful firms leverage those core competencies to create and implement value-adding strategies that satisfy customer needs and preferences. Firms that align their core competencies with customer needs, and then continuously improve, innovate, and upgrade their competencies accordingly, have the potential to meet and exceed customers&rsquo; expectations over time. In that way, the sustainability of a firm&rsquo;s competitive advantage is a function of the alignment of core competencies and customer needs combined with continual improvement.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c21 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">RESPONSE_QUESTION: &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">How much do you include your customers in your strategic decision making processes?</span></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.j7zp8ke1sg4o"><span class="c4">Business-level Strategies</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c1 c5">Business-level strategies</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;represent coordinated sets of actions that leverage core competencies to create a competitive advantage. An effectively formulated strategy integrates and allocates a firm&rsquo;s resources, capabilities, and competencies to be properly aligned with its external environment. As such, business-level strategies indicate how a firm chooses to compete in a particular market to gain a competitive advantage over rivals in the marketplace. Business-level strategies create differences between the firm&rsquo;s competitive position and those of its rivals as a firm must decide whether it intends to perform the same activities differently or to perform different activities altogether.</span></p><p class="c48"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 498.00px; height: 303.00px;"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Wumw-ElaLZIyK4-1DdM07_0NXHMqj7ycMNOvcEmSJtTsV9-3zcupyvIza2FO99WZMhIGCkMFrUssQ7bYZ6Abx923TZNUf4u68NsaH_560__BPV8vPuy-02VfsF31ClRzVqr28VRL" style="width: 498.00px; height: 303.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c21 c1">Generic Strategies</span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c3">Classified as &ldquo;generic&rdquo; because they can be applied across most industries, products, and public or private sectors, these strategies are situated on a graph based on source of competitive advantage &ndash; either uniqueness or cost &ndash; and the scope of operations &ndash; either broad or narrow. Obviously, the effectiveness of each strategy depends on the alignment between internal and external conditions and how the firm executes that strategy. No one strategy is superior to another in all circumstances, and within each industry (similar to strategic groups) firms are able to be successful by following vastly different strategies.

The cost leadership strategy usually requires standardized goods or services and process innovations designed to produce and distribute goods or services efficiently. This includes supply chain management that emphasizes partnerships with producers and streamlined distribution channels that help keeps costs as low as possible. Cost leaders also need to routinely examine all business activities to uncover additional areas for improvement and cost reductions, which could include heavy investment in state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities and/or logistical processes. Customers targeted by a cost leadership strategy tend to be very price conscious and may value a low price above most other concerns.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Firms following a cost leadership strategy successfully typically focus on the following areas:</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_gshti76eshxc-0 start"><li class="c0"><span class="c3">Simplification of processes and procedures</span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c3">Achieving efficiency and effectiveness</span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c3">Reducing costs throughout all levels of the organization</span></li><li class="c49 c26"><span class="c3">Monitoring costs of activities provided by external parties that interface with the firm&rsquo;s inbound or outbound logistics</span></li></ul><p class="c11"><span class="c21 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 493.00px; height: 304.00px;"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/5LxuEaEC6eldijJDqJ0V-7lO7am-17LWpHjGbq3W8fd0tJ6IPQQ235dqnPLc4OzXOKPyHIfJIYIghLUgm1_O_ZFSExyfShUEiaEuJize9Zl3g6sXK8TaSkADFjMaugnIp_UAYO0b" style="width: 493.00px; height: 304.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11 c10"><span class="c21 c1"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">RESPONSE_QUESTION: &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages of a cost leadership strategy?</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c21 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c21 c1">Cost Leadership and Five Forces</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">As an example of the impact strategic decision makers can have on the processes and outcomes of the firm, the following section highlights how a cost leadership strategy can minimize or reduce the influence of Porter&rsquo;s Five Forces.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">Power of Suppliers:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Low-cost leaders can absorb a greater amount of cost increases from powerful suppliers before it must raise prices charged to customers. In addition, combined with dominant market share, a low-cost leader may be in a position to force suppliers to reduce prices or to hold down the level of price increases, and thus reduce the power of suppliers.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Power of Buyers:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;the lowest cost producer has a larger cushion between the price it charges for its goods or services and the cost to produce those goods and services, so if buyers put pressure on the price it charges, it can still remain profitable. In addition, if buyers attempt to drive prices below the cost of the next most efficient firm, that firm might choose to exit the market (rather than remain and earn below average profits), leaving the low cost firm with a monopoly position. If that happens, customers would lose any bargaining power as the monopoly firm would be in a position to raise prices.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Intensity of Rivalry:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;a firm&rsquo;s rivals will hesitate to compete based on price because, in a price war, the low cost firm has a bigger cushion between its price and costs, which will allow it to still earn a profit longer that rivals.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Threat of Substitutes:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Low-cost leaders can more easily lower prices to maintain the price-value relationship with current customers and reduce the attractiveness of substitute goods and services.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Threat of New Entrants:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Low-cost leaders typically must produce and sell in large volumes and focus on efficiency and cost reduction, so new must either enter the industry at a large scale (large enough to achieve the same economies of scale as the next lowest cost firm) or be satisfied with average profits until they move sufficiently far down the experience curve to match the efficiencies of the low-cost leader.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Several competitive risks of a cost leadership strategy also exist as firms are always susceptible to the strategic actions of rivals. First, the processes used by the cost leader may become obsolete such that the cost advantage of the firm would erode based on newer technologies. Rivals may also catch up to the cost leader and leverage their own scale advantages to reduce the power of the former cost leader. Rivals might also find a way to imitate or substitute for the cost leader&rsquo;s strategic advantage by using its own core competencies. Further, the pursuit of a cost leadership strategy may occur at the expense of customers&rsquo; perceptions of value, where the goods or services provided are seen as &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;inexpensive.&rdquo; Lastly, the cost leader might suffer from a lack of identification of changes in customer needs and preferences and get left behind by those changing trends.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 499.00px; height: 305.00px;"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/5YFvUwqRt-Gv4_wdCceUOFMrPEHDlufAf1SCh6XtrsGnPn6DqU_FYDF9z-8qHtf1qtWWHNK5N1sXd61AupyUj9BJdADZwPUZL1Vx5GYd2i_h0Z03zHQHrxLzs843N9MLYFet9ZpD" style="width: 499.00px; height: 305.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.4s630dnem04d"><span class="c4">Differentiation</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c15">A </span><span class="c1">differentiation</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;strategy emphasizes actions to produce goods or services (at an acceptable cost) with characteristics customers perceive as offering greater quality, features, and/or value relative to competitors. Although with any business endeavor, cost is certainly a matter of concern, but the focus of the differentiation strategy is to make something unique and special such that customers would be willing to pay a premium for it. Competition, then, is not focused on the price of the product but rather what it does that is superior to other products or services. Differentiation can come from various sources, including but not limited to, high quality, unusual, unique, or additional features, responsive customer service, rapid product innovation, advanced technological features, high performance, and an image of prestige or status.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">In order to successfully implement a differentiation strategy, high investment in activities such as research and development, innovation, and marketing is usually required. The creativity and ingenuity of the firm is also important to produce a solution to customers&rsquo; problems in new and innovative ways. Customers targeted by a differentiation strategy usually do not place price as the highest priority but rather are more concerned about the functionality and quality of the product or service and how it solves their particular problem better than other alternatives. As such, they are generally willing to pay a higher price, thus allowing the firm to earn a profit with higher margins.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 496.00px; height: 305.00px;"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/37Kzfj-rEn7UQpmeGJNzW2nPQZBpSKIwR5RHeq5AB9GADtCK43HEuYuqn5UsI1kknn2UUiUm9KBiwa1q2dGdHAg-6PVtHpEDIAxPc1QrdRzPBZUrZykc6sEwm-Jhzk3-kLyp5KLj" style="width: 496.00px; height: 305.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11 c10"><span class="c21 c1"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">RESPONSE_QUESTION: &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages of a differentiation strategy?</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c21 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c21 c1">Differentiation and Five Forces</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">As an example of the impact strategic decision makers can have on the processes and outcomes of the firm, the following section highlights how a differentiation strategy can minimize or reduce the influence of Porter&rsquo;s Five Forces.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Power of Suppliers:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Differentiation often allows firms to charge higher prices, thus making large margins, which puts them in a better position to absorb any price increases from suppliers.

In addition, the characteristics of the differentiated product increase the switching costs between other products or services.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Threat of New Entrants:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;The high customer loyalty resulting from a uniquely differentiated product or service would take a lot of time and investment for a new entrant to achieve, who must either overcome or surpass the uniqueness of existing products or provide similarly differentiated products at a lower price to increase the value provided to the customer.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Several competitive risks also exist for a differentiation strategy. First, although the brand loyalty that often comes with a differentiation strategy reduces customers&rsquo; sensitivity to price, it is still a contributing factor to a perception of value, and when the price differential between the differentiator&rsquo;s product or service and the cost leader&rsquo;s becomes too large, the value of the former is diminished. As a result, the differentiation ceases to provide value for which the customers are willing to pay. Further, as customers gain experience with the product and perhaps other rivals&rsquo; goods or substitute products, the value of the differentiated features is narrowed. Finally, the price premium of differentiated products is eroded when counterfeit goods replicate the differentiated features of the firm&rsquo;s products.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 497.00px; height: 305.00px;"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/E-t-TCHLxRDxVddEa4oUNsurang-O9Er23P1VJr585ykQ_zLubFkIK5Z1zWPB6eKZReeOLFcgwt9Rik1c16KBgCLLTvKah2m8Nt6-KCTHRzaZNwrZT8KEsnPzARRt1oVPm4fRDH1" style="width: 497.00px; height: 305.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1 c37">Competence Check: </span><span class="c3 c37">Which generic business-level strategy is more likely to spend the most on advertising and promotion?</span></p><p class="c11 c10"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.aqcgtucjl058"><span class="c4">Blue Ocean Strategy</span></h2><p class="c7"><span class="c15">A relatively recent strategic theory builds upon the &ldquo;integrated&rdquo; strategy of cost leadership and differentiation, but instead focuses on how the strategic actions by firms can completely change the nature of competition &ndash; and profitability &ndash; in entire industries. The </span><span class="c1">Blue Ocean Strategy</span><span class="c3">, introduced by Kim &amp; Mauborgne in 2005, uses an analogy of an ocean to describe competitive behavior between firms. When these firms (sharks) compete directly, blood is in the water and no firm really has a sustainable advantage over the others. Instead, they suggest implementing &ldquo;value innovation&rdquo; and swimming to blue oceans where no other sharks (firms) are competing, which changes market boundaries and industry structures. Value innovation means increasing value for customers by creating new benefits and services, while simultaneously reducing costs by eliminating less valuable features or services, which rejects the traditionally accepted trade-off between differentiation and lower cost. The &ldquo;Four Actions Framework&rdquo; details how this can be accomplished.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Four actions framework:</span></p><ol class="c20 lst-kix_bkmrpbdhrd16-0 start" start="1"><li class="c7 c26"><span class="c3">Eliminate: Which of the factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated?</span></li><li class="c7 c26"><span class="c3">Reduce: Which factors should be reduced well below the industry standard?</span></li><li class="c7 c26"><span class="c3">Raise: Which factors should be raised well above the industry standard?</span></li><li class="c7 c26"><span class="c3">Create: Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered?</span></li></ol><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11 c10"><span class="c21 c1"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">RESPONSE_QUESTION: &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">What firms can you think of that have successfully implemented a Blue Ocean Strategy?</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Successfully implementing the Blue Ocean Strategy takes a special ability to see opportunities where others do not. By building capabilities in these new markets, firms are able to innovate in a way that adds value by combining both differentiation and low cost strategies. One key to success with this strategy is recognizing the current benefits and pain points of the customer experience and creating a product or service that maximizes the benefits and reduces the pain points to create a sustainable competitive advantage. The results of Blue Ocean strategies tend to be more radical and disruptive in nature and, if done properly, can make it difficult for competitors to imitate, protecting the firm&rsquo;s competitive advantage. Another positive outcome of a successful Blue Ocean strategy is attracting an entirely new set of customers that weren&rsquo;t interested in previous offerings; by doing so, firms can expand the potential market and help reduce head-to-head competition for a previously limited market boundary. </span></p><p class="c9"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 61.00px; height: 72.00px;"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KSsiXKKYEZiUqo5JMx3zMYk0BmBAVXqoZzKXWRkiqD7QO2wslIsbRrzruD1JyeYnbHfFyBvyANuspWEQGBDOeLRBJNf4RtyZ8gB1h0HTS3aDNcpk3-hQcnq04rBZ4csC2mWwI4Lr" style="width: 61.00px; height: 72.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Application: </span><span class="c3">What business-level strategies are most appropriate for your entrepreneurial endeavors?</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c31 c32" id="h.gtfqdb9o3m8f"><span class="c25">Wall Street Journal Articles</span></h3><p class="c13"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c33"><span class="c15 c22">WSJ Article: </span><span class="c19 c15"><a class="c34" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-dollar-general-became-rural-americas-store-of-choice-1512401992?mod%3Ddjem10point&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1608617130816000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2BRtQQqsd8FqkiVWHS2nG5">How Dollar General Became Rural America&rsquo;s Store of Choice (Links to an external site.)</a></span></p><p class="c7 c18"><span class="c15 c17">1. &nbsp; &nbsp; What generic business-level strategy is Dollar General following?

Morris Air was a low-fare airline that pioneered many cost-saving practices that later became standard in the industry, such as e-ticketing. After working as an airline executive for SWA, Neeleman founded another low-cost airline, JetBlue Airways, in 1998. At the same time, he also wanted to offer better service and more amenities.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JetBlue started by using just one type of airplane (the Airbus A320) and chose to fly point to point, directly connecting highly trafficked city pairs. In contrast, legacy airlines such as Delta, United, and American use a hub-and-spoke system; such systems connect many different locations via layovers at airport hubs. The point-to-point business model focuses on directly connecting fewer but more highly trafficked city pairs.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of JetBlue&rsquo;s other features include high-end 100-seat Embraer regional jets with leather seats, free movie and television programming via DirecTV, XM Satellite Radio, along with friendly and attentive on-board service. Other amenities include its recently added Mint class, which offers personal check-in and early boarding, free bag checking and priority bag retrieval after flight, and complimentary gourmet food and alcoholic beverages in flight. It also features small private suites with a lie-flat bed up to 6 feet 8 inches long, a 15-inch high-resolution personal screen, and free in-flight high-speed Wi-Fi (&ldquo;Fly-Fi&rdquo;). JetBlue is also adding the newer Airbus 321 to its fleet, which scores significantly higher in customer satisfaction surveys than the older Airbus 320.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, because roughly one-third of customers prefer speaking to a live reservation agent, despite a highly functional website for reservations and other travel-related services, JetBlue decided to employ stay-at-home parents in the United States instead of following industry best practices by outsourcing its reservation system to India. The company suggests this &ldquo;home sourcing&rdquo; is more productive than outsourcing; it also says that customers&rsquo; appreciation of the reservation experience more than makes up for the wage differential between the United States and India. To sum it up, JetBlue&rsquo;s &ldquo;Customer Bill of Rights&rdquo; declare its dedication to &ldquo;bringing humanity back to air travel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">1.

Often a firm must continue to innovate and improve its product/service offerings to keep up and surpass its competitors. From this perspective, competition is a positive thing because it keeps the firm sharp.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Carl Karcher, founder of the Carl&rsquo;s Jr. hamburger chain, had this to say about competition: &ldquo;I had always said that competition just makes you stronger. You shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of the competition. They make you stay on top of your game. If another chain started near a Carl&rsquo;s Jr., it showed we had a good location and it brought more people in . . . I may have had a different philosophy than some of the others, but I believe that your competitors are really your friends. They keep you on your toes.&rdquo; In-N-Out Burger, Chapter 3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">No competition is not always a good thing. Perhaps a market doesn&rsquo;t exist, the economics are such that it&rsquo;s not really a good opportunity, or maybe an effective business model doesn&rsquo;t exist for the firm. So even though no competition has been described as a potential Blue Ocean opportunity, it could very well be no sharks are swimming there for a reason.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c11 c10"><span class="c21 c1"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">Reflection Questions: </span><span class="c3">What are some benefits of competition?</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c21 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c21 c1">Who Are Your Competitors?</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c15">Before understanding how to compete with rivals, identifying who your rivals are becomes a critical first step. Competition can be organized into three types. The first is </span><span class="c1">direct competition</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;where rivals are easily defined, offer similar types of products that solve the same problem, and have a comparable resource base. An example of this is Pepsi and Coke, who except for the most die hard of soda aficionados, are more or less indistinguishable. The next is </span><span class="c1">indirect competition</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;where rivals are less easily identifiable. For example, Coke and bottled water could be in this category, since both are beverages but satisfy thirst in different ways. Coke has diversified by launching Dasani, its own bottled water brand, to enter this segment of the market. Finally </span><span class="c1">remote competition</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is a category where rivals are based on solving a particular problem rather than the specific characteristics of the product. So for Coke, fresh fruit might be a remote competitor for those who want something sweet and will choose between either a soda or fruit. Ideologies might also be at competition here, since customers trying to eat healthily might choose fruit over a carbonated beverage. The key here is to get into the minds of the customers to understand what problem they are trying to solve and to make sure the firm is paying attention to trends and potential threats, both inside and outside the current industry.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 351.00px;"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NWBQj7rHrKku9d-IOQaI1SLFLvgFj0cOA7acdtN_6Z6vsFniQ_rjuNX3wyX7bbCtigeJMEzUdWEfkRBnfrJ6THTwyPZWOGoN4ORM-oOQ06-h1_J2pcyfWcEPoWf9T6CgqzdWO345" style="width: 624.00px; height: 351.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11 c10"><span class="c21 c1"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">RESPONSE_QUESTION: &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">How might expanding the definition of competitors &ndash; which may change your focus on the underlying problem being solved &ndash; help you innovate or anticipate competitive actions and reactions?</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c7 c31" id="h.jho7wgokluc"><span class="c4">The AMC Model of Competitive Rivalry</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c1 c5">Competitive rivalry</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;exists when firms interact with one another to pursue an advantageous market position. The factors that influence the timing, intensity, duration, and overall number of competitive actions and reactions have several different dimensions. One popular framework for understanding and predicting competitive dynamics is the awareness, motivation, capabilities (AMC) perspective. The AMC framework argues a firm is more likely to respond to a competitive action by its rival to the extent it is </span><span class="c1">aware</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;of the action, is </span><span class="c1">motivated</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;to respond, and has the </span><span class="c1">capabilities</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;to do so. Awareness is the attention paid to certain rivals, who may either have a reputation as a strategic threat or is a sufficient enough player for a firm to monitor. Sometimes firms suffer from </span><span class="c1">competitive blind spots</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;by not paying close enough attention to actions by lesser-known rivals; when these actions fit the preferences of customers better than current product or service offerings, even well-established firms can be disrupted and go bankrupt. Motivation to respond to a competitor&rsquo;s attack is increased when market dependence is high, meaning the product or geographic arena is strategically important, either from a profitability perspective, locational advantage, or some other vital operational purpose. Capabilities to respond are built up over time and depend on the investment made into organizational resources.</span></p><p class="c8 c10"><span class="c21 c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">RESPONSE_QUESTION: &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">What might cause a firm to have competitive blind spots, or to overlook certain firms as important rivals?</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c15">The AMC perspective is evident when analyzing the market commonality and resource similarity between two firms. </span><span class="c1">Market commonality</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;represents the degree to which firms compete in the same market or markets, including product markets and geographic markets. Using the airline industry as an example, each city to which the airline flies can be considered a market; thus, more market commonality exists as the number of cities two airlines service increases, with an accompanying increase in competitive behavior. Because these firms engage in multimarket competition, they are more aware</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c15">of each other&rsquo;s strategic actions and are more likely to respond to them. This increase in the frequency of interaction provides firms with a history of one another, which can help them predict what a firm will do based on that past history. Increased levels of competitive interaction also increase the motivation</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">for firms to respond quickly and intensely to competitive attacks to not only reduce the advantage the initial action produced, but also to deter similar attacks in the other markets the firms share.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c15">One perspective that is an extension of market commonality argues for reduced incentive for firms to initiate competitive rivalry. The </span><span class="c1">mutual forbearance </span><span class="c3">theory suggests firms that are involved in multimarket competition will be less likely to engage in a competitive attack because of the numerous markets in which a retaliation could be expected. However, once attacked, this theory predicts an intense reaction to protect the multiple markets in which the firms compete.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Resource similarity</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;refers to the extent to which both the type and amount a firm&rsquo;s tangible and intangible resources are comparable to a competitor&rsquo;s. Firms with similar types and amounts of resources are likely to have similar strengths and weaknesses and to use similar strategies when faced with similar external conditions. As such, the firms are more likely to develop comparable capabilities</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c3">which means they are more apt to compete in the marketplace. In contrast to market commonality, assessing resource similarity can be difficult, especially for critical resources that are intangible (e.g., brand name, knowledge, trust, capacity to innovate) rather than tangible (e.g., access to raw materials, ability to borrow capital).</span></p><p class="c8 c10"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1 c37">Competence Check: </span><span class="c3 c37">Firms that compete for the same customers exhibit market commonality or resource similarity?</span></p><p class="c8 c10"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">The AMC perspective also helps to explain competitive dynamics with other firm characteristics that manifest themselves from resource similarity, such as firm size. Larger firms may not have the awareness or motivation to compete directly against smaller firms, as smaller firms can often fly below the radar of larger firms. In turn, smaller firms don&rsquo;t have the necessary resources or capabilities to compete directly with larger firms. Thus the AMC perspective would predict the speed, intensity, and duration of competitive actions and reactions will be higher with firms of similar size.</span></p><p class="c36"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 496.00px; height: 305.00px;"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6M76bUN9LA9HBbSBOXStgSQ476CkbtSFdPsYvqfKQZBm5dYMYVqjIrUURUlAU24uZI92FqLQWs_RYho5mxRci5P_VK_SwV818Xmmsou0oiBqNPk6ZKJAiaH94rHQP7SgVIvzRM8l" style="width: 496.00px; height: 305.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h2 class="c31 c47" id="h.uzjnzs2pkxf5"><span class="c4">Strategic and Tactical Actions</span></h2><p class="c44"><span class="c21 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c44"><span class="c15">In the field of competitive dynamics, competitive actions usually take one of two forms. The first is </span><span class="c1">strategic actions</span><span class="c15">, which involve significant commitment or organizational resources and are difficult to implement or reverse. Examples of strategic actions include mergers and acquisitions, significant long-term investments in research and development, and international expansion. </span><span class="c1">Tactical actions</span><span class="c3">, on the other hand, involve less commitment and fewer resources and are relatively easier to implement or reverse. Price changes, marketing campaigns, and the hiring of new employees are examples of tactical actions.

As this module illustrates, the actions and reactions of rivals in the marketplace have a big impact on the success of the strategy chosen and implemented. So not only is the success of a strategy determined by the firm&rsquo;s initial competitive actions, but also by how well the firm anticipates competitors&rsquo; responses to them and how well those actions respond to previous actions taken by rivals. Competitive dynamics has a dominant influence on the firm&rsquo;s choice of an appropriate business-level strategy and the effectiveness of its implementation.</span></p><p class="c44"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c28"><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 499.00px; height: 305.00px;"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ETzhoHSVtlxkSuKsYbjsya5xkfGxLLVNnGiokIgcSAp2Kyc34nYT_-_vBj0Pumk9LBgrejoHHBqYgy0nwRyugnxK0uacqRH2vR0iaya41paojqm73sO0ZCnJG4M7qQc2o3eL75Am" style="width: 499.00px; height: 305.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c9 c10"><span class="c21 c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 61.00px; height: 72.00px;"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bZ3SN8ZVZtZ-_aqqjG16tH2P3Hy6FlAu4r7K3yKRhU0YzkqiCx5mSyG5Vtt_ZaHKLHaD6YhmJV_ypUlxNWC0WBU9v458SkMV2A8k09txbAn_XEdpRl13csbZtfSdL4zDx9CXDkBf" style="width: 61.00px; height: 72.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c9 c10"><span class="c21 c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Application: </span><span class="c3">What elements of competitive dynamics will be most influential to your entrepreneurial endeavors?</span></p><p class="c44"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c24" id="h.cjbt6sv7jmr1"><span class="c25">Wall Street Journal Articles</span></h3><p class="c52"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c33"><span class="c15 c22">WSJ Article: </span><span class="c19 c15"><a class="c34" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-and-amazon-bicker-roku-may-win-1512584270?mod%3Ditp%26mod%3DdjemITP_h&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1608617130828000&amp;usg=AOvVaw14TXVjC2YtBZceKo4HmnX7">Google and Amazon Bicker: Roku May Win (Links to an external site.)</a></span></p><p class="c7 c18"><span class="c17 c15">1. &nbsp; &nbsp; Explain the nature of multi-market competition between Amazon, Google, and Roku.</span></p><p class="c7 c18"><span class="c17 c15">2. &nbsp; &nbsp; What is the impact of these competitive dynamics? &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c33"><span class="c15 c22">WSJ Article: </span><span class="c19 c15"><a class="c34" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-to-reel-in-tiktok-creators-raising-stakes-in-social-media-rivalry-11595928600?mod%3Ddjemwhatsnews&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1608617130829000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1jdgH4lsjK9t0fvYh0DN0k">Facebook Seeks to Reel In TikTok Creators, Raising Stakes in Social-Media Rivalry (Links to an external site.)</a></span></p><p class="c7 c18"><span class="c17 c15">1. &nbsp; &nbsp; How and why are InstaFace and TikTok competitors?</span></p><p class="c7 c18"><span class="c17 c15">2. &nbsp; &nbsp; What strategic and tactical actions do you see InstaFace and TikTok making?</span></p><p class="c52"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c24" id="h.qibcavhysog"><span class="c25">Mini-case: Competitive Dynamics</span></h3><p class="c52"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3">Blockbuster</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Netflix provides rental DVDs through the mail rather than via the bricks-and-mortar rental outlets favored by Blockbuster. Blockbuster has built a competitive advantage on the premise that customers can get DVDs they want immediately and often have multiple copies of popular titles to ensure no stock out occurs. Despite this, the founders of Netflix realized that Blockbuster&rsquo;s customers had points of pain: they had to drive to the store, search through rows of movies, often not find the one they were seeking as it was already rented out, and pay late charges if they forgot to return it on time. Netflix solved these points of pain by mailing the movies directly to the customer and movies can be kept as long as a customer wishes with no late charges.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When John Antioco, CEO of Blockbuster, first encountered Netflix, he did not see it as a threat, stating, &ldquo;No one will want to wait three days for a movie.&rdquo; In fact, having a wish list and allowing a subscriber to hold several DVDs simultaneously avoids this supposed disadvantage. And because inventory is stored centrally, a greater selection is possible at a much lower cost. The Netflix business model innovation is &ldquo;disruptive&rdquo; to Blockbuster, which has invested much in stores and local inventories. Blockbuster countered the competitive actions of Netflix by offering its own movie-by-mail system through its existing website called Blockbuster Online that allowed customers to order DVDs to receive through the mail and (for higher-tiered customers) provide coupons for free in-store rentals. Initially, the price for Blockbuster Online and Netflix was the same, but Blockbuster eventually had to raise its prices to cover the additional costs of owning and operating physical stores. This strategy ultimately failed, causing Blockbuster to declare bankruptcy and to close all but one of its stores.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, Netflix began seeing an impact of a disruptive technology on its own business through the evolution of broadband networks that can deliver on-demand streamed content. This allowed new competitors to enter the market and challenge Netflix. In addition, competitors in the physical DVD space also began to emerge. Redbox, with its a vending machine style delivery system and flexible pricing system, found a cheaper way to distribute physical DVDs to satisfy customers&rsquo; impulse to watch a movie without having to manage a queue or wait for it to be delivered. Although still charging late fees, not as numerous as Blockbuster stores once were, and not able to provide the same breadth of selection, Redbox kiosks are located in heavily trafficked areas to help satisfy customers&rsquo; need for convenience, providing an alternative to Netflix&rsquo;s movie-by-mail system. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c21 c1">DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">1.
